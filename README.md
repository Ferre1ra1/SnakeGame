# Snake Game
Snake Game made in java 

> I recommend installing the zip file and running it in your own IDE, I used **NetBeans** but you can feel free to use **eclipse** or **Visual Studio Code**.

###Project Summary: Snake Game in simple Java
* The "Snake Game" project in Java is a classic game in which players control a snake to eat fruit and grow while avoiding colliding with itself or the edges of the game. 
* The game features simple graphics, intuitive controls and increases in speed as the snake grows. 

#### Bugs: 
* Apple is generated outside the panel.
